# Team: 406 Not Acceptable


## Brief problem statement 

The motivation for this Platform for Scout Troops is to facilitate fundraising and event management of each of the troops. Additionally, the main task of the application platform is to manage the each of the troops inventory so the Scouts can focus on selling more inventory and reduce paperwork required. Moreover, troops will have special events throughout their sales season, so they should be able to manage the inventory. 

## System requirements

- Latest Web Browser: Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox

- NodeJS, Express, FireBase(or equivalent), MariaDB, Angular


## Users profile

The system is intended for scout troop leaders and parents of the scouts. The minimum IT skills required for using the web-app includes, using a computer, accessing a website, signing up, and inputting data. They should also be familiar with using other smart devices such as a smartphone or a tablet.

Parents should be fully responsible and understand the objective of the fundraising program.

The troop leaders should have a good understanding of the application and how to manage their groups. They should also have some experience in reading data statistics since the web-app outputs them in different graphs.
